## Python Development Environment with Docker
This repository provides a setup for Python development using Docker containers. Docker allows you to isolate your development environment, ensuring consistency across different systems and easing the setup process for new team members.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have Docker installed on your system. You can download and install Docker from the official Docker website.

## Getting Started
To get started with this Python development environment, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/JeffreyOmoakah/python-docker.git

Navigate to the Repository: cd fastapi-image

Build the Docker Image: docker build -t fastapi-image

Run the Docker Container: docker run -it --rm fastapi.image

This command will start a Docker container based on the image we just built and drop you into a shell inside the container.

## Development Workflow
Once inside the Docker container, you have a Python environment ready for development. You can write your Python scripts, install dependencies using pip, and run your applications.

- Edit Python Files: Use your favorite text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) to modify Python files within the container.
- Install Dependencies: If your project requires additional Python packages, you can install them using pip. Any packages installed will be isolated within the Docker container.
Run Python Scripts: Execute your Python scripts directly from the container's command line.

## Notes
- Persistent Storage: By default, the container's file system is ephemeral, meaning any changes made will be lost once the container is stopped. Consider mounting volumes to persist your code and data between container sessions.
- Docker Compose: For more complex applications with multiple services, consider using Docker Compose to define and run multi-container Docker applications.
- Environment Variables: You can pass environment variables to the container using the -e flag when running docker run.
